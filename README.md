# DVD Rental SQL Analysis üìÄ
This project is a showcase of my SQL querying and data analysis skills, built using the [DVD Rental sample database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/) in PostgreSQL. I tackled 15 real-world business questions that explore **customer behavior**, **movie rentals**, **inventory**, and **store-specific performance**.

Each question is solved using efficient SQL queries and includes screenshots of results run in pgAdmin. This project demonstrates my ability to extract actionable insights from relational databases using joins, aggregations, filters, and subqueries.

## üß† Why This Project?

Understanding customer activity, rental patterns, and store operations are key to running a data-driven business. This project shows how structured data can answer operational questions and uncover insights that drive better decisions.

If you are looking for a data analyst who can write clean, business-relevant SQL and communicate insights clearly,
